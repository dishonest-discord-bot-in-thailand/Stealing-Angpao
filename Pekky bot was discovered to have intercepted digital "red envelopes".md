Two years ago, the Pekky bot was discovered to have intercepted digital "red envelopes" — a common form of monetary gift exchange in many online communities. It was found that once the bot detected messages containing these red envelopes, it would automatically capture them using a specific portion of its code known as the "Message Intent." This part of the bot's programming allowed it to act without a command prefix, essentially processing the data directly. The intercepted funds were returned only to the person who caught the bot in the act, leaving previous victims uncompensated and without a public acknowledgment of the issue.

This bot had been promoted on "Discord underground" , which controversially continued to endorse the bot and even appointed the developer, who was responsible for the malfunction, as an admin in the DiscordBOT Thailand Community—a group supposedly dedicated to supporting and promoting bots.

The motivation behind these actions seems to stem from the financial pressures of maintaining a bot that supports around one hundred thousand guilds. The high operational costs and the competitive bot market likely pushed the developer to adopt this unethical shortcut.

Currently, the bot no longer steals red envelopes, but it retains the capability to access user messages through its Message Intent function. This continues to raise trust issues, as there has been no rectification for the incidents or compensation for past victims.
